🎨 Simon Says – Pattern Memory Game

A fun and interactive pattern memory game built in Java AWT.
Your goal is simple: watch the flashing buttons and repeat the sequence correctly.
Each round adds one more step to the sequence — how far can your memory go? 🧠✨

🕹️ Features
- Beautiful Pastel UI – soothing color palette for a clean, modern look
- Interactive Gameplay – buttons flash in sequence, you repeat to progress
- Increasing Difficulty – sequence grows every round
- Game Over Screen – play again or exit with a single click

OOP Architecture – clean and modular code (separate classes for game logic, UI, and buttons)

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Java
- GUI: AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)

💡 Why I Built This
- I wanted to create a simple yet challenging game to practice:
- Java GUI programming using AWT
- Event-driven design
- OOP principles like encapsulation and class separation
- This project was a great way to combine logic, creativity, and clean coding practices.

Enjoy the game! 🎮
